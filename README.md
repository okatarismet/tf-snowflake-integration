## Terraform and Snowflake Integration
Objective: Leverage Terraform to automate the provisioning of Snowflake resources, ensuring adherence to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) best practices.

### Task Description:
As part of this task, you are to create a series of Terraform scripts/modules that will provision the following Snowflake resources:
1. Warehouse: A compute warehouse suitable for processing queries and data manipulation tasks.
2. Database: A dedicated database to house various schemas and tables.
3. Schema: Within the database, create a specific schema intended for the tables.
4. Table: A table within the schema that includes at least four columns of varying data types.
5. Role: A role with permissions that allow for database, schema, and warehouse access, and select privileges on the table.

### Requirements:
- Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY): Write modular Terraform code, reusing blocks where possible to minimize repetition.
- Avoid Hardcoding: No hardcoded values should be used for any inputs that might vary between deployments (e.g., warehouse sizes, database names). Use Terraform variables and input variables files where appropriate.
- Parameterization: Ensure that resource names and other significant parameters can be easily altered without changing the main script logic.
- Security: Ensure that sensitive information is not exposed and that the principle of least privilege is followed when assigning role permissions.
- Documentation: Provide clear documentation within the code, including comments and a README file detailing how to use the scripts/modules.
- Version Control: Maintain the code in a version-controlled repository with appropriate commit messages.

### Deliverables:
- Terraform scripts/modules with a clear directory structure.
- A variables.tf file defining all the required inputs.
- A terraform.tfvars.example file that provides template values for the variables.
- A README.md file explaining the purpose of the scripts/modules, how to configure and run them, and any prerequisites or dependencies.
- Any additional scripts or tools used for the setup should be included in the repository with explanations in the README.md.

### Evaluation Criteria:
- Functionality: The Terraform code should execute without errors and create the resources as defined.
- Best Practices: The code should reflect Terraform and IaC best practices.
- Modularity and Reusability: Scripts/modules should be written in a way that they can be reused in different environments or scenarios.
- Documentation: Documentation should be clear, concise, and sufficient for a new user to understand and use the codebase.
- Code Quality: The code should be well-organized, commented, and easy to maintain.
## Features
Warehouse Management: Automate the creation and configuration of Snowflake warehouses with customizable settings.
Database and Schema Setup: Easily provision databases and schemas to organize your data logically.
Table Creation: Define and manage tables within your schemas for structured data storage.
Role Management: Provision roles with specific privileges for granular access control.
## Requirements
Terraform: Version 0.13 or newer.
Snowflake Provider: Snowflake-Labs/snowflake provider version ~> 0.76.
## Usage
To use this module in your Terraform configuration, follow these steps:

Provider Configuration:
Ensure the Snowflake provider is configured in your Terraform:


Copy code
```hcl
terraform {
required_providers {
snowflake = {
source = "Snowflake-Labs/snowflake"
version = "~> 0.76"
}
}
}
```

```hcl
provider "snowflake" {
account = var.account
user = var.username
password = var.password
role = var.role_name
}
```
Module Inclusion:
Incorporate this module into your Terraform configuration to manage Snowflake resources:

```hcl
module "snowflake_setup" {
source = "./path/to/snowflake_module"
```

# Variables for warehouse configuration

warehouse_name = "your_warehouse_name"
warehouse_size = "X-Small"
auto_suspend = 60
initially_suspended = true

# Database and schema configuration

database_name = "your_database_name"
schema_name = "your_schema_name"

# Role and privileges setup

role_name = "your_role_name"
table_name = "your_table_name"
}
Replace ./path/to/snowflake_module with the actual path to the Snowflake module.

Variables
This module requires the following inputs:

account
username
password
role_name
warehouse_name
warehouse_size
database_name
schema_name
table_name
Refer to the variables.tf file for detailed descriptions and default values of all variables.

Outputs
The module provides outputs that can be used in other parts of your Terraform configuration, such as the names of the created resources. Refer to outputs.tf for details.
